# ✈️ Airbnb Host Passport

**Airbnb Host Passport** is an implementation of the new Flip UI in the Airbnb app using Dart and Flutter. I took so much inspiration from the implementation of [Roaa94's Airbnb UI](https://www.github.com/roaa94/flutter_airbnb_ui), you can even say I **"stole"** some of their code 😆 I really enjoyed learning from them and working on this project, it gave me a better understanding about how animations work in Flutter.

Star :star2: the repo if you like what you see :wink: **NOTE:** Changes are still being made
